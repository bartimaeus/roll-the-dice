/*
 * Control flow helps to control your code's
 * results based on conditions or user inerations.
 *
 *
 * Conditional statements
 *
 * Here is an example of a basic if...else. If a
 * condition is true, then execute the if block.
 * Otherwise, execute the else block:
 *
 *    const status = isRegisteredToVote();
 *    if (status === 'yes') {
 *      showVoteForm();
 *    } else {
 *      showSorryScreen();
 *    }
 *
 *
 * If statements can get very long and complex.
 * You might see Logical operators used in if statements:
 *
 *    const recycleDay = 'Wednesday';
 *    if (currentDay.weekday() && currentDay.day() === recycleDay) {
 *      console.log('put out the recycle bin today!');
 *    }
 *
 *
 * You can have many if...else conditions as follows:
 *
 *    const favoriteColor = 'blue';
 *    if (favoriteColor === 'red') {
 *      console.log('yeah red!');
 *    } else if (favoriteColor === 'green') {
 *      console.log('yeah green!');
 *    } else if (favoriteColor === 'blue') {
 *      console.log('yeah blue!');
 *    } else {
 *      console.log('Oops! your color is not cool!');
 *    }
 *
 *
 * Often when we start seeing a lot of if...else statements
 * we should replace them with a switch.
 *
 *    const favoriteColor = 'blue';
 *    switch (favoriteColor) {
 *      case 'red':
 *        console.log('yeah red!');
 *        break;
 *      case 'green':
 *        console.log('yeah green!');
 *        break;
 *      case 'blue':
 *        console.log('yeah blue!');
 *        break;
 *      default:
 *        console.log('Oops! your color is not cool!');
 *    }
