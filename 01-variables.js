/*
 * Variables in Javascript are a way to store a value for later use.
 * Variables can store any type of primitive as well as other objects,
 * functions, and structures we'll learn about later.
 *
 * In the past, variables were created using the keyword `var`:
 *
 * var name = 'Eric';
 *
 * Using the keyword `var` we can create a varialbe and change
 * the value any time we like. Because this leads to possible
 * issues with overwriting values the JavaScript standard has
 * changed by adding two new keywords that can create variables
 * `let` and `const`.
 *
 * let name = 'Eric';
 * const given = 'Shelley';
 *
 * The difference between `let` and `const` is the desire to change
 * a variable later on. `const` makes the variable a constant and
 * will throw and error if you try reassign it:
 *
 * const name = 'Eric';
 * name = 'It\'s me again'; =>  TypeError: Assignment of constant variable
 *
 * let name = '';
 * name = 'Eric'; => Success!
 *
 * There are other reasons to use `let` and `const`. If you want to know more
 * you can follow the doc links below. Getting started I would stick with
 * using `const` unless you have a good reason to use `let`.
 *
 * let docs: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let
 * const docs: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const

 * ~> OBJECTIVE:
 *
 * Create a few variables that describe yourself or your favorite hobby
