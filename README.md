# Roll the Dice

This project was created for the North Lake Coding Camp. A summer group organized to help kids and parents learn to code together!

Roll the dice should help you get your feet wet writing JavaScript. We'll try and start out with a few concepts and then slowly add more and more to our project.

We'll break the project into two phases.

1.  Basics of JavaScript
2.  Single Player
3.  Multiplayer

Hopefully, by the end you will feel comfortable with JavaScript.

## Project Files

All of the project files are broken down into steps. Each file is numbered based on the order we'll use to learn each concept.

## Code Editor

### jsbin

[jsbin](http://jsbin.com/?html,output) is an online editor that will give instant feedback on the code we write. You can copy and paste the starter file into jsbin and start coding right away!

### Visual Studio Code

If you want to save the code locally, then we'll use VS Code. [Download Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

## More JS Please!

After this basic introduction you'll probably want more. There are lots of free resources out there like:

- [Mimo](https://getmimo.com/) - Learn to code on the go!
- [Codcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)

I personally like how [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/) teaches and the content he offers. I would check out his [ES6 for Everyone](https://es6.io/) course.
